# Structure of the directory

To keep things simple and to allow the use of the jukebox for multi-part music a
lbums & stories, media are stored using the following structure:

> 1 card = 1 id = 1 album = 1 folder = 1 info file + 1 or more media files

The name of the album doesn't matter (usually something Composer-Title). A scan 
is ran at the start-up and the association id <-> path kept in memory.

In theory, it should be possible to read the content of a folder sorted by name, at random, etc... but so far this hasn't been implemented.

```_PLAYER``` is mandatory and contains the main software
